You can also have an else without the elif:

1. Print "Hello Netzwerk Academy" if a is greater than b.
2. Print "Hello Netzwerk Academy" if a is not equal to b.
3. Print "Yes" if a is equal to b, otherwise print "No".
4. Print "1" if a is equal to b, print "2" if a is greater than b, otherwise print "3".
5. Print "Hello" if a is equal to b, and c is equal to d.
6. Print "Hello" if a is equal to b, or if c is equal to d.
7. Print i as long as i is less than 8.
8. Loop through the items in the fruits list.
 fruits = ["apple", "banana", "mango"]
9. In the loop, when the item value is "banana", jump directly to the next item.
fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]
10. Exit the loop when x is "banana".
fruits = ["apple", "banana", "mango"]
